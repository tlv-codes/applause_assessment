### Tim Vogel's Applause application materials repo

In this repo you will find part 1, and part 2 of Tim Vogel's Applause assessment. 

##### Part 1:
a jupyter notebook with a function that takes a user's input for both country and device and returns a sorted output of testers based on their experience finding bugs on whatever devices they possess. 

##### Part 2:
a written document explaining how, with historical data from 100k testers, I would create a machine learning algorithm to predict the number of bugs a new tester would find.




Thanks,

Tim
